Health Monitoring System will record the patientâ€™s heart beat rate and body temperature and the data is send to Thingspeak channel. With the help of MATLAB analysis and TimeControl email is send after every 5 min, mentioning the BPM condition of the patient. If the BPM of the patient goes below or abobe certain threshold then LED glows and buzzer also start to buzz.

### **Working** ###

1. Setting up all the connections code uploading / Configuring Thingspeak channel
2. Pulse rate and temperature sensor will continously monitor the patients pulse rate and temperature
3. The monitored vlaues will be sent to thingspeak , where it will continously analysed
4. MATLAB analysis will analysed the channel reading, for sending email as alert
5. Timecontrol will send email after every 5 minutes in collaboration with MATLAB analysis
6. LED will glow and buzzer will buzz if the Pulse rate goes below/above threshold value
